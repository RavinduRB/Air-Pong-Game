## 🖐️🎮 Air Pong Game Powered by Hand Gestures and AI 🚀

I'm excited to showcase one of my coolest project, **Air Pong**, an interactive game that uses **real-time hand gesture control** to play. No keyboard or mouse required. Just move your **index finger**, and the paddle follows you 💥.

With the help of **MediaPipe and OpenCV**, your webcam detects your hand movements and lets you control the paddle in a three ball Pong game. It's intuitive, immersive, and a fun blend of AI and computer vision. 👾

### ✨ Key Features

     ✅Real-time hand tracking
     ✅Multiple bouncing balls for added challenge
     ✅Simple and user friendly GUI menu
     ✅Score tracking and game over detection
     ✅Smooth motion control with just your hand
